description: "The Roman history is divided into 3 main sections: the Monarchy, the Republic, the Empire. The Monarchy was a phase where Rome was ruled by a series of kings. The Republic was characterised by a system of checks and balances designed to prevent the concentration of power. The Republic's inability to manage its vast territories and internal conflicts let to the rise of autocratic rule. Augustus, adopted son of Julius Ceaser, after the death of Ceaser centralised power, creating a stable but authoritarian goverment which was called the Roman Empire. Here begins our journey to find out what led to the fall of such a vast empire,a topic which has created debate between historians for centuries, what it left with us and is it somehow similar to the present. Let's begin contemplating!"
