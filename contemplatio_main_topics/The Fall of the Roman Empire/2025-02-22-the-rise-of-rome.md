# Title: The rise of Rome: A journey to Power and Empire

Any empire, before falling needs to rise. So how did such a Rome rise? Well, it all began in 753 BCE when the Roman Kingdom was established by Romulus, who due to a small quarrel had killed his own brother Remus. It's a long story and mythological! However, it does portray Rome's desire to connect their origins to divine and heroic figures, emphasizing their destiny for greatness. Now, let's start!

Rome was located about 24 km up the Tibet River from the Mediterranean Sea. It was build on seven steep hills to stop enemies from attacking.
